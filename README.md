## :information_source: About

An Obsidian.md vault for my math course notes in university (integrated with my [dotfiles](https://github.com/zhaoshenzhai/dotfiles)).

### File structure

Each note is currently one of four types:
* **Definition**, either of an `object` or of a `notion`, which links to
  * Types: _Objects/notions of type `object`/`notion` with additional restrictions. (Definition)_
  * Examples: _Objects that are specific instances of `notion` - including its proof, if necessary. (Definition/Proposition)_
  * Constructions: _Objects that can be defined from `object`, or notions derived from `notion`. (Definition)_
  * Generalizations: _Abstractions of `object`/`notion`. (Definition)_<br/><br/>
  * Properties: _Statements regarding `object` or necessary conditions of `notion`. (Proposition/Theorem)_
  * Sufficiencies: _Proofs that other objects are of type `object` or sufficient conditions of `notion` (Proposition/Theorem)_
  * Equivalences: _Equivalent definitions for `object` or biconditionals between notions and `notion`. (Proposition/Theorem)_
  * Justifications: _Proofs of well-definition of `object`. (Proposition)_
 
* **Proposition** and **Theorem** (differentiated by 'importance'), including both statement and `proof` regarding `object`/`notion`, which links to
  * Proved by: _Statements in which `proof` depends crucially on. (Axiom/Proposition/Theorem)_
  * Generalizations: _Statements and proofs of generalizations of `object`/`notion`. (Proposition/Theorem)_

* **Axiom**, written as a formal `statement` within a certain framework, which links to
  * Equivalences: _Equivalent statements - including its proof. (Proposition/Theorem)_
  * Constructions: Objects/notions that crucially depend on `statement`. (Definition)
