!!! ad-Proposition Proposition.

Let $X$ be a set. The collection $\l\{X\r\}$ is a basis for the trivial topology on $X$.

--- admonition

_Proof_. We first verify that $\l\{X\r\}$ is indeed a basis for a topology on $X$:
* ($\axibasis{1}$): Observe that $X\subseteq\bigcup\l\{X\r\}=X$.
* ($\axibasis{2}$): Take $B_3=X$ since $B_1=B_2=X$.

Recall that $\mc{T}_\textrm{trivial}=\l\{\em,X\r\}$. It suffices to find some subset of $\l\{X\r\}$ such that its union is either $\em$ or $X$.
* To generate $\em$, take the subset $\em\subseteq\l\{X\r\}$ and observe that $\em=\bigcup\em$.
* To generate $X$, take the subset $\l\{X\r\}\subseteq\l\{X\r\}$ and observe that $X=\bigcup\l\{X\r\}$.<span style="float:right;">$\blacksquare$</span>
