!!! ad-Axiom Axiom.

Consider the first-order logic with a set of non-logical symbols $\mc{L}=\l\{\in,S\r\}$. The **Axiom of Infinity** is the $\mc{L}$-formula
$$\begin{equation}
    \ex I\l[\em\in I\land\fa i\in I:S\l(i\r)\in I\r].
\end{equation}$$

--- admonition

**Remark.** This axiom does not directly define the $\textrm{`}$set of all natural numbers$\textrm{'}$ $\omega$. Rather, it asserts the existence of some inductive set that, by the Principle of Ordinary Induction, contains $\omega$ as a subset.<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>
