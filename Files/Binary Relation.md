!!! ad-Definition Definition.

_A set $R$ is a **binary relation** if $R$ is a set of ordered pairs. Formally,_
$$\begin{equation}
    R\textit{ is a binary relation}\ \ \ \ \Leftrightarrow\ \ \ \ \fa u\in R,\ex x,y:u=\l\langle x,y\r\rangle.
\end{equation}$$

--- admonition

**Remark.**
* If $R$ is a binary relation and $\l\langle x,y\r\rangle\in R$, write $xRy$.
* If there exists some set $X$ such that $x,y\in X$, then $R$ is said to be **homogeneous on $X$** or is a **binary relation on $X$**.<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>
