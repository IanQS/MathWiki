!!! ad-Definition Definition.

Consider the first-order logic with a set of non-logical symbols $\mc{L}=\l\{\in\r\}$. Then
* the **subset** relation $u\subseteq v$ is the $\mc{L}$-formula $\fa x\l(x\in u\Rightarrow x\in v\r)$ and
* the **proper subset** relation $u\subset v$ is the $\mc{L}$-formula $u\subseteq v\land u\neq v$.
