!!! ad-Proposition Proposition.

Let $X$ be a set. Then the pair $\l\langle\mc{P}\l(X\r),\subseteq\r\rangle$, where $\subseteq$ is regarded as a binary relation, is a poset.

--- admonition

_Proof_. This is trivial since $\subseteq$ is already a transitive relation on $\mc{P}\l(X\r)$, and the fact that $Y\subseteq Y$ for all $Y\in\mc{P}\l(X\r)$ is trivial.<span style="float:right;">$\blacksquare$</span>
