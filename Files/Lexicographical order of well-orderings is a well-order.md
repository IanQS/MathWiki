Proved by: [[Strict lexicographical order is total if orders are strictly total]]
Generalizations: _Not Applicable_

!!! ad-Proposition Proposition.

Let $<$ and $\prec$ be well-orders on the sets $X$ and $Y$, respectively, Then the strict lexicographical order $\sqsubset$ on $X\times Y$ is a well-order on $X\times Y$.

--- admonition

_Proof_. Since $<$ and $\prec$ are strict total orders on $X$ and $Y$, respectively, we see that $\sqsubset$ is a strict total order on $X\times Y$. Hence it suffices to show that $\sqsubset$ is well-founded on $X\times Y$. To this end, take a non-empty subset $S\subseteq X\times Y$.
