!!! ad-Proposition Proposition.

Let $A$ be a set. For every $a\in A$, we have $a\subseteq\bigcup A$.

--- admonition

_Proof_. If $A=\em$, then the result is vacuously true. Assume otherwise and take $a\in A$. If $a=\em$, it is also vacuously true that $\em\subseteq\bigcup A$. Thus take $c\in a$. Certainly there exists some $u\in A$ such that $c\in u$, namely $u=a$. By the Axiom of Union, we have $c\in\bigcup A$. Since $c$ is arbitrary, the result follows.<span style="float:right;">$\blacksquare$</span>
