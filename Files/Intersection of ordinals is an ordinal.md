!!! ad-Proposition Proposition.

For all ordinals $\alpha$ and $\beta$, we have $\alpha\cap\beta\in\ord$.

--- admonition

_Proof_. Since $\in$ well-orders $\alpha$ and $\alpha\cap\beta\subseteq\alpha$, we see that $\in$ well-orders $\alpha\cap\beta$ too. To show that $\alpha\cap\beta$ is a transitive set, take sets $x$ and $y$ such that $x\in y$ and $y\in\alpha\cap\beta$. It follows that $y\in\alpha\land y\in\beta$, and since both $\alpha,\beta\in\ord$, they are transitive sets and thus $x\in\alpha\land x\in\beta$. Hence $x\in\alpha\cap\beta$ and thus $\alpha\cap\beta\in\ord$.<span style="float:right;">$\blacksquare$</span>
