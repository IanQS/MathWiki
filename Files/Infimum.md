!!! ad-Definition Definition.

Let $\l\langle X,<\r\rangle$ be a poset and fix $S\subseteq X$. The **infimum of $S$ in $X$** is a lower bound $l$ of $S$ such that $x\leq l$ for all lower bounds $x$ of $S$.

--- admonition

**Remark.** If $l$ is the infimum of $S$, write $\inf S\coloneqq l$. In the context of lattice theory, the infimum is also called the **meet of $S$** and is denoted by $\bigwedge S$.<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>
