!!! ad-Proposition Proposition.

Let $n$ be a natural number. Then every element $m\in n$ is also a natural number.

--- admonition

_Proof_. Since $\ord$ is a transitive class and $n\in\ord$, we see that $m\in\ord$ too and thus $m\in n$ implies $m\subseteq n$. Take $\alpha\in\ord$ such that $\alpha\subseteq m$, so we have $\alpha\subseteq n$. Since $n$ is a natural number, we see that either $\alpha=\em$ or $\alpha$ is a successor ordinal.<span style="float:right;">$\blacksquare$</span>

**Remark.** Once the set of natural numbers $\omega$ is defined, this states that $\omega$ is an initial segment of $\ord$.<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>
