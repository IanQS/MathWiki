!!! ad-Definition Definition.

_Let $<$ be the standard ordering on the real numbers $\mb{R}$. The **standard topology on $\mb{R}$** is the order topology_ $\mc{T}(<)$_._

--- admonition

**Remark.** Since $\mb{R}$ is unbounded (in both directions), we see that $\mc{T}\l(<\r)\coloneqq\mc{T}\l(\mc{B}\r)$ where
$$\begin{equation}
    \mc{B}\coloneqq\l\{B\in\mc{P}\l(\mb{R}\r)\mid\ex a,b\in\mb{R}:a<b\land B=\l(a,b\r)\r\}.\exqedin
\end{equation}$$
