title: Proposition.

_Let $A$ and $B$ be sets. If $A\subseteq B$, then $\mc{P}A\subseteq\mc{P}B$._

```

_Proof_. Take $x\in\mc{P}A$, so $x\subseteq A$. Since $A\subseteq B$, we see that $x\subseteq B$ and thus $x\in\mc{P}B$. Since $x$ is arbitrary, we have $\mc{P}A\subseteq\mc{P}B$.<span style="float:right;">$\blacksquare$</span>
