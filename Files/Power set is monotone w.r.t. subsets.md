!!! ad-Proposition Proposition.

Let $A$ and $B$ be sets. If $A\subseteq B$, then $\ms{P}A\subseteq\ms{P}B$.

--- admonition

_Proof_. Take $x\in\ms{P}A$, so $x\subseteq A$. Since $A\subseteq B$, we see that $x\subseteq B$ and thus $x\in\ms{P}B$. Since $x$ is arbitrary, we have $\ms{P}A\subseteq\ms{P}B$.<span style="float:right;">$\blacksquare$</span>
