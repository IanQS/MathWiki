!!! ad-Definition Definition.

_Let $u$ be a set and let $z$ be any set asserted by the Axiom of Union. The **union of $u$** is the set_
$$\begin{equation}
    \bigcup u\coloneqq\l\{x\in z\mid\ex v\l(x\in v\land v\in u\r)\r\}.
\end{equation}$$

--- admonition

**Remark.** For the pair set $\l\{u,v\r\}$, write $u\cup v\coloneqq\bigcup\l\{u,v\r\}$.<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>

---

**Remark.** One can also write the union $\bigcup u$ using $\textrm{`}$index$\textrm{'}$ notation as $\bigcup_{v\in u}v$.<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>
