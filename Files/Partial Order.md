!!! ad-Definition Definition.

Let $X$ be a set. A binary relation $R$ is a **partial order on $X$** if $R$ is transitive and irreflexive on $X$.

--- admonition

**Remark.** Let $<$ be a partial order on a set $X$. Write $>\,\coloneqq\,<^{-1}$, $\leq\,\coloneqq\,<\cup\id_X$, and $\geq\,\coloneqq\,\leq^{-1}$. The relations $\leq$ and $\geq$ are called **non-strict partial orders on $X$** defined as transitive and reflexive binary relations on $X$.<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>
