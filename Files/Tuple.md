!!! ad-Definition Definition.

Let $X$ and $I=\l\{1,\dots,n\r\}$ be sets. Elements of the function space $X^n\coloneqq X^I$ are called **$n$-tuples** and are written as $\l\langle x_1,\dots,x_n\r\rangle$ where each $x_i\in X$.

--- admonition

**Remark.** The notation $X^n\coloneqq X^I$ is in fact an equality if we defined this more set-theoretically since $I=\l\{0,\dots, n-1\r\}=n$.<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>
