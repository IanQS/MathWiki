!!! ad-Definition Definition.

_Let_ $\mc{T}_\mb{R}$ _be the standard topology on the real numbers $\mb{R}$. The **standard topology on $\mb{R}^2$** is the product topology_ $\mc{T}_\textrm{st}\coloneqq\mc{T}_\mb{R}\times\mc{T}_\mb{R}$_ on $\mb{R}^2$._

--- admonition

**Remark.** Since $\mc{T}_\textrm{st}$ can be generated by the basis $\mc{B}_\textrm{st}$ containing all Cartesian products of open intervals in $\mb{R}$, that is, basis elements in $\mc{B}_\mb{R}$ where $\mc{T}_\mb{R}=\mc{T}\l(\mc{B}_\mb{R}\r)$ is the standard topology, we can visualize elements in $\mc{B}_\textrm{st}$ the interior of a rectangle.

Furthermore, since $\mc{T}_\mb{R}$ can also be generated by the basis $\mc{B}_\mb{R}'$ containing open intervals in $\mb{R}$ with rational endpoints, the collection $\mc{B}_\textrm{st}'$ containing Cartesian products of elements thereof also form a basis for $\mc{T}_\textrm{st}$.<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>
