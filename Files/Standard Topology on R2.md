title: Definition.

_Let_ $\mc{T}_\R$ _be the standard topology on the real numbers $\R$. The **standard topology on $\R^2$** is the product topology_ $\mc{T}_\textrm{st}\coloneqq\mc{T}_\R\times\mc{T}_\R$_ on $\R^2$._

```

**Remark.** Since $\mc{T}_\textrm{st}$ can be generated by the basis $\mc{B}_\textrm{st}$ containing all Cartesian products of open intervals in $\R$, that is, basis elements in $\mc{B}_\R$ where $\mc{T}_\R=\mc{T}\l(\mc{B}_\R\r)$ is the standard topology, we can visualize elements in $\mc{B}_\textrm{st}$ the interior of a rectangle.

Furthermore, since $\mc{T}_\R$ can also be generated by the basis $\mc{B}_\R'$ containing open intervals in $\R$ with rational endpoints, the collection $\mc{B}_\textrm{st}'$ containing Cartesian products of elements thereof also form a basis for $\mc{T}_\textrm{st}$.<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>
