title: Definition.

_Let $K$ be a field and consider an $m\times n$ matrix $A\in\mat{m\times n}{K}$ for some fixed $m,n\in\N$. The **null space of $A$** is the linear subspace of $K^n$ consisting of the set_
$$\begin{equation}
    \null\l(A\r)\coloneqq\l\{\v{x}\in K^n\mid A\v{x}=\v{0}\r\}
\end{equation}$$
_together with its induced operations from $K^n$._

```

**Remark.** In other words, $\null\l(A\r)$ is the solution space of the homogeneous linear system $A\v{x}=\v{0}$.<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>
