title: Definition.

_Let $X$ and $Y$ be sets. A function $f:X\to Y$ is said to be **invertible** if there exists a function $g:Y\to X$ such that the diagram_

_commutes; that is, if $g$ is both a left and a right-inverse of $f$, in which case we write $g\coloneqq f^{-1}$ and call it the **inverse of $f$**. If such a function $f$ exists, then $X$ and $Y$ are said to be **isomorphic as sets**._

```

**Remark.** That is, invertible functions are isomorphisms in $\catset$. Since $\textrm{`}$is isomorphic to$\textrm{'}$ is an equivalence relation, we shall write $X\iso Y$.<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>
