title: Definition.

_A function $f:X\to Y$ is a **surjection w.r.t. $Y$** if $\ran f=Y$._

```

**Remark.**
* Note that surjection is not a property of the function $f$ itself; rather, it is a combined property of both the function and some superset $Y$ of $\ran f$. Of course, this does not apply if $f$ is defined as a triple $\tpl{\Gamma_{\mathclap{f}}\ ,X,Y}$.

* From now on, if we write $f:X\to Y$, surjectivity is assumed to be w.r.t. $Y$ unless otherwise specified.
* If $f:X\to Y$ is a surjection (or a **surjective function**, or a function that **maps onto $Y$**), write $f:X\onto Y$.<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>
