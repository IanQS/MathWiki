title: Definition.

_A function $f:X\to Y$ is a **surjection w.r.t. $Y$** if $\ran f=Y$._

```

**Remark.** Note that surjection is not a property of the function $f$ itself; rather, it is a combined property of both the function and some superset $Y$ of $\ran f$. Of course, this does not apply if $f$ is defined as a triple $\tpl{\Gamma_{\mathclap{f}}\ ,X,Y}$.
* From now on, if we write $f:X\to Y$, surjectivity is assumed to be w.r.t. $Y$ unless otherwise specified.
* If $f:X\to Y$ is a surjection (or a **surjective function**, or a function that **maps onto $Y$**), write $f:X\onto Y$.

However, if functions are defined as tuples $f\coloneqq\tpl{\Gamma_{\!f},X,Y}$, then surjectivity _is_ a property of $f$ itself (since $Y$ is fixed).<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>
