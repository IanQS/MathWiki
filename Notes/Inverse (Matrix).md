title: Definition.

_Let $K$ be a field and take $A\in\mat{n}{K}$ for some fixed $n\in\N$. A matrix $B\in\mat{n}{K}$ is said to be the **inverse of $A$** if $AB=BA=I_n$._

```

**Remark.** Note that inverses are only defined for square matrices. If an inverse exists, then it is unique and can thus be denoted as $A^{-1}$.<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>
