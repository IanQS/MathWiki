$\huge\rm\bf{R}\normalsize\rm\bf{ING THEORY}$ is the study of the [category of rings](obsidian://open?file=TODO); that is, the study of [rings](Ring.md) and [homomorphisms](Ring%20Homomorphism.md) between them.

**Constructions.** As with most categories, $\catring$ has [subobjects](Subring.md), [products](obsidian://open?file=TODO), [direct sums](obsidian://open?file=TODO), and [quotients](Quotient%20Ring.md). Unique to Ring Theory is the concept of an [ideal](Ideal.md) $I$ in $R$, defined as subrngs that are stable under multiplication. These are precisely the subrngs that furnishes a compatible ring structure on its quotient.

Similarly, as with most categories, we can define the [kernel](Kernel%20(Ring%20Theory).md) and the image of a [homomorphism](Ring%20Homomorphism.md) $\phi:R\to S$. Furthermore, $\ker\phi$ is an ideal in $R$, so $\phi$ decomposes into

which, in particular, implies the [First Isomorphism Theorem](obsidian://open?file=TODO).<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>
