title: Definition.

Let $G$ be a group and take $g\in G$. If there exists some $n\in\N^+$ such that $g^n=e$, then $g$ is said to have **finite order**, in which case the **order of $g$** is
$$\begin{equation}
    \l|g\r|\coloneqq\min\l\{n\in\N^+\mid g^n=e\r\}.
\end{equation}$$
Otherwise, $g$ is said to have **infinite order**.

```

<b>Remark.</b> We define the **order of $G$** to be its cardinality $\l|G\r|$. By Lagrange$\textrm{'}$s Theorem, we see that $g^{\l|G\r|}=e$.<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>
