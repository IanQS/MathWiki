title: Theorem.

_Let $V$ and $W$ be finite-dimensional vector spaces over some field $K$ with bases $\mc{B}$ and $\mc{C}$, respectively, and let $T:V\to W$ be linear. Then $T$ is invertible iff any of the following equivalent statements hold:_
* _$\dim V=\dim W$ and $T$ is injective._
* _$\dim V=\dim W$ and $T$ is surjective._
* _The matrix representation_ $\l[T\r]_\mc{B}^\mc{C}$ _is invertible._
