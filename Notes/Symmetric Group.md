title: Definition.

_Let $X$ be a set. The **symmetric group on $X$** is the automorphism group $\Sym\l(X\r)\coloneqq\Aut\l(X\r)$. A subgroup of $\Sym\l(X\r)$ is called a **permutation group on $X$**._

```

**Remark.** If $X=\l\{1,\dots,n\r\}$, as is usually the case, we denote $S_n\coloneqq\Sym\l(\l\{1,\dots,n\r\}\r)$. In this case, we note that $S_n$ is generated by transpositions, which are bijections $\tau:X\to X$ such that there exist distinct $i,j\in X$ with $\tau\l(i\r)=j$, $\tau\l(j\r)=i$, and $\tau\l(k\r)=k$ for all $k\neq i,j$. Indeed, if $\sigma\in S_n$ is not the identity, then there exist some $i,j\in X$ such that $\sigma\l(i\r)=j$. Let $\tau$ be the transposition that interchanges $i$ and $j$, so $\tau\sigma$ fixes $i$. If $\tau\sigma=\id_X$, we are done. Otherwise, we proceed by induction to write $\tau\sigma$ as a product of transpositions in $\Sym\l(X\comp\l\{i\r\}\r)$, so we are done.
