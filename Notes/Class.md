``` ad-Definition
title: Definition.(Informal).

_Let $\phi\l(x\r)$ be a formula. The expression $\l\{x\mid\phi\l(x\r)\r\}$ is, informally, called a **class**._

```

**Remark.** A class $z$ can be thought of as a collection of objects $x$ that satisfies a certain property, in this case the formula $\phi\l(x\r)$. Write, _informally_, the expression $x\in z$.
* If all such objects $x$ are elements of some set $v$, then we have $\fa x\l[x\in z\Leftrightarrow\l(x\in v\land\phi\l(x\r)\r)\r]$. Thus the class $z$ is, by Specification, a set.
* Otherwise, the class $z$ is called a **proper class**.<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>
