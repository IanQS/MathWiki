title: Definition.

Let $R$ be a ring with unit. The **group of units of $R$** is the group $R^\times\coloneqq\l\{u\in R\mid\ex r\in R:ur=1=ru\r\}$. Elements of $R^\times$ are called **units**.

```

<b>Remark.</b> Observe that $R^\times=R\comp\l\{0\r\}$ iff $R$ is a division ring.<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>

<b>Remark.</b> Since $\cdot$ is an associative binary operation on $R$ with an identity, and we restrict to only those elements with a multiplicative inverse, we see that $\tpl{R^\times,\cdot}$ is a group.<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>
