``` ad-Proposition
title: Proposition.

_Let $\l\langle X,\leq\r\rangle$ be a poset and fix $S\subseteq X$. If $u$ and $u'$ are both suprema of $S$, then $u=u'$. Similarly for infima._

```

_Proof_. If $u$ and $u'$ are suprema of $S$, then, by definition, we have $u\leq u'$ and $u'\leq u$. Since $\leq$ is antisymmetric on $X$, we see that $u=u'$. Similarly for infima.<span style="float:right;">$\blacksquare$</span>
