title: Definition.

_Let_ $\sttopR$ _be the standard topology on the real numbers $\R$. The **standard topology on $\R^2$** is the product topology_ $\sttopR[2]\coloneqq\sttopR\times\sttopR$_ on $\R^2$._

```

**Remark.** Since $\sttopR[2]$ can be generated by the basis $\mc{B}$ containing all Cartesian products of open intervals in $\R$, we can visualize elements in $\mc{B}$ the interior of a rectangle.

Furthermore, since $\sttopR$ can also be generated by the basis $\mc{B}_\R'$ containing open intervals in $\R$ with rational endpoints, the collection $\mc{B}'$ containing Cartesian products of elements thereof also form a basis for $\sttopR[2]$.<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>
