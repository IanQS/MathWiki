title: Definition.

_Let $R$ and $S$ be rings. We say that $R$ and $S$ are **isomorphic as rings** if there exists an invertible ring homomorphism $\phi:R\to S$, called a **ring isomorphism**._

```

**Remark.** That is, ring isomorphisms are isomorphisms in $\catring$. Since $\textrm{`}$is isomorphic to$\textrm{'}$ is an equivalence relation, we shall write $R\iso S$.<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>
