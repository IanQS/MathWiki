title: Definition.

_Let $\l\langle K,+,\cdot\r\rangle$ be a field. A **zero vector space over $K$** is a quintuple $\l\langle\l\{0\r\},K,\oplus,\odot,0\r\rangle$ where_
* _$0$ is any set,_
* _$\oplus:\l\{0\r\}\times\l\{0\r\}\to\l\{0\r\}$ is defined by $0\oplus0=0$, and_
* _$\odot:K\times\l\{0\r\}\to\l\{0\r\}$ is defined by $\alpha\odot0=0$ for all $\alpha\in K$._

```

**Remark.** Since $0$ is any set, there are many zero vector spaces over $K$. However, they are all isomorphic and we can thus refer to $\textrm{`}$the$\textrm{'}$ zero vector space. Note that since the data of $\oplus$ and $\odot$ are uniquely defined, we can simply call $\l\{0\r\}$ the zero vector space.<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>
