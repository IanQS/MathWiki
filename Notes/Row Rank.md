title: Definition.

_Let $K$ be a field and consider a matrix $A\in\mat{m\times n}{K}$ for some fixed $m,n\in\N^\ast$. The **(row) rank of $A$** is the number $\row\rank\l(A\r)=r$ where $r$ is the number of leading $1\textrm{'}$s in $R\coloneqq\rref\l(A\r)$._

```

**Remark.** Equivalently, since a row of $R$ contains a leading $1$ iff it is a non-zero row (this follows from $\axiref[2]$), we see that $\row\rank\l(A\r)$ is the number of non-zero rows of $R$.<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>

**Remark.** Since $\col\rank\l(A\r)=\row\rank\l(A\r)$, we shall simply denote both by $\rank\l(A\r)$.<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>
