title: Proposition.(Burali-Forti Paradox).

_The collection of all ordinals $\ord$ is a proper class._

```

_Proof_. Suppose, for sake of contradiction, that $\ord$ is a set. It follows that $\ord$ is a transitive set and that $\in$ well-orders $\ord$, so, by definition, we see that $\ord$ is an ordinal number. But then $\ord\in\ord$, contradicting the fact that $\in$ is irreflexive on $\ord$.<span style="float:right;">$\blacksquare$</span>
