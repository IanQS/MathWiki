``` ad-Proposition
title: Proposition (Burali-Forti Paradox).

_The collection of all ordinals $\ON$ is a proper class._

```

_Proof_. Suppose, for sake of contradiction, that $\ON$ is a set. It follows that $\ON$ is a transitive set and that $\in$ well-orders $\ON$, so, by definition, we see that $\ON$ is an ordinal number. But then $\ON\in\ON$, contradicting the fact that $\in$ is irreflexive on $\ON$.<span style="float:right;">$\blacksquare$</span>
