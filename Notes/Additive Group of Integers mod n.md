title: Definition.

_Fix $n\in\N^+$ and consider the equivalence relation $\mod{n}$ of congruence modulo $n$ on $\Z$. The **additive group of integers modulo $n$** is the Abelian group $\l(\Z/n\Z,+_n\r)$ where_
* _$\Z/n\Z$ is the quotient set of $\Z$ under $\mod{n}$, and_
* _$+_n:\Z/n\Z\times\Z/n\Z\to\Z/n\Z$ is the binary operation defined by $\l(\l[a\r],\l[b\r]\r)\mapsto\l[a+b\r]$._
