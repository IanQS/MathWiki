``` ad-Definition
title: Definition.

_Fix $n\in\N^+$ and consider the normal subgroup $n\Z\nsubgrpeq\Z$. The **additive group of integers modulo $n$** is the quotient group $\l(\Z/n\Z,+_n\r)$ of $\Z$ under $n\Z$._

```

**Remark.** Those groups, together with $\Z$ itself, are the _only_ cyclic groups.<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>

**Remark.** Unraveling the definition, we see that elements $a+n\Z\in\Z/n\Z$ are equivalence classes containing all integers $b\in\Z$ such that $n\divides\l(b-a\r)$; that is, all $b\in\Z$ such that $b=a+nk$ for some $k\in\Z$.<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>

**Remark.** Write $\Z_n\coloneqq\Z/n\Z$ instead. Also, since $\Z$ is Abelian, we see that $\Z_n$ is Abelian too.<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>
