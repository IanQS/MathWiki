``` ad-Definition
title: Definition.

_Let $V$ and $W$ be vector spaces over some field $K$ and consider a linear map $T:V\to W$. The **image of $T$** is the linear subspace $\im T$ of $W$._

```

**Remark.** We define the **column space** of a matrix $A\in\mat{m\times n}{K}$ as $\col A\coloneqq\im L_A$.<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>
