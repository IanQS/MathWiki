``` ad-Proposition
title: Proposition.

_Let $K$ be a field and let $V$ be a vector space over $K$. If $U\subseteq V$ is linearly independent, then there exists a basis $\mc{B}$ of $V$ with $U\subseteq\mc{B}$._

```

**Remark.** In other words, every linearly independent subset of a vector space can be extended to a basis. The finite-dimensional case can be proved using just induction (in fact, it is constructive), but the infinite-dimensional case requires Zorn's Lemma.<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>
