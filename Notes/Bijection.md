title: Definition.

_A function $f:X\to Y$ is a **bijection** if $f:X\to Y$ is both an injection and a surjection._

```

**Remark.** If $f:X\to Y$ is a bijection (or a **bijective function**, or an **isomorphism between sets**), write $f:X\rightleftarrows Y$ or $f:X\simto Y$ and say that the sets $X$ and $Y$ are **in one-to-one correspondence** or **isomorphic**, in which case we also write $X\iso Y$.<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>
