title: Definition.

_Let $V$ be a $K$-vector space and fix a subset $U\subseteq V$. Then $U$ is a **($K$-linear) subspace of $V$** if $U$ is a vector space under the induced operations._

```

**Remark.** It is clear that $U\subseteq V$ is a subspace of $V$ if $0\in U$ and $U$ is closed under linear combinations.<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>
