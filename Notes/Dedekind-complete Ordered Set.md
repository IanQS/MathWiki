title: Definition.

_A partially ordered set $\l\langle X,\leq\r\rangle$ is said to be **Dedekind-complete** or satisfies the **least upper bound property** if every non-empty subset $S\subseteq X$ that is bounded above admits a supremum in $X$._

```

**Remark.** Dually, a poset $\l\langle X,\leq\r\rangle$ is said to satisfy the **greatest lower bound property** if every non-empty subset $S\subseteq X$ that is bounded below admits an infimum. The terminology $\textrm{`}$Dedekind-complete$\textrm{'}$, which does not differentiate between the two, is justified by the fact that they are equivalent.<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>
