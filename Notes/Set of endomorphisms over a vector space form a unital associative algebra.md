``` ad-Proposition
title: Proposition.

_Let $V$ be a vector space over some field $K$. Then $\edm\l(V\r)$, together with the composition operation $\circ$, is a unital associative algebra over $K$._

```

_Proof_. From the links above, we see that $\edm\l(V\r)$ is a vector space over $K$ and that the composition
$$\begin{equation}
    \circ:\edm\l(V\r)\times\edm\l(V\r)\to\edm\l(V\r)
\end{equation}$$
is a unital and associative binary operation that distributes over $+$ and is compatible with $\cdot$.<span style="float:right;">$\blacksquare$</span>
