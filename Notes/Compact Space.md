``` ad-Definition
title: Definition.

A topological space $\tpl{X,\mc{T}}$ is said to be **compact** if every open cover has a finite subcover; that is, if for all $\mc{O}\subseteq\mc{T}$ such that $X=\bigcup\mc{O}$, then there exists some finite $\mc{O}'\subseteq\mc{O}$ such that $X=\bigcup\mc{O}'$.
