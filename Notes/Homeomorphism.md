title: Definition.

_Let $X$ and $Y$ be topological spaces. A continuous map $f:X\to Y$ is a **homeomorphism** if there exists a continuous map $g:Y\to X$ such that $g\circ f=\id_X$ and $f\circ g=\id_Y$._
* _If such a function exists, then $X$ and $Y$ are said to be **homeomorphic**, and we write $X\iso Y$._
