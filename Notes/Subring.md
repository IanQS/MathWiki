title: Definition.

_Let $\tpl{R,+,\cdot}$ be a ring and fix a subset $S\subseteq R$. The pair_ $\tpl{S,\l.+\r|_{S\times S},\l.\cdot\r|_{S\times S}}$ _is a **subring of $\tpl{R,+,\cdot}$** if it is itself a ring._

```

**Remark.** Subrings of $R$ must be subsets of $R$ equipped with the _restricted_ binary operation, not just any binary operation. It is clear that $S\subseteq R$ is a subring of $R$ iff it is a subgroup that is closed under multiplication. If rings are taken to have a unit, then we must have $1\in S$ too.<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>
