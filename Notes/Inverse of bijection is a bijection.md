title: Proposition.

_Let $f:X\to Y$ be a bijection. Then the inverse function $f^{-1}:Y\to X$ is also a bijection._

```

_Proof_. It suffices to show that $f^{-1}$ has both a left and right inverse, but this follows directly from the fact that $f^{-1}$ is the inverse of $f$, which states
$$\begin{equation}
    f^{-1}\circ f=\id_X\ \ \ \ \textrm{and}\ \ \ \ f\circ f^{-1}=\id_Y.\qedin
\end{equation}$$
