title: Definition.

_The **category of sets** is the category $\cat{Set}$ whose objects are sets and whose morphisms between objects $X,Y\in\obj\l(\cat{Set}\r)$ are functions $f:X\to Y$. Formally,_
* _$\obj\l(\cat{Set}\r)\coloneqq V$ where $V$ is the universal class,_
* _for all sets $X$ and $Y$, $\hom\l(Y,X\r)\coloneqq Y^X$ is the function space from $X$ into $Y$,_
* _for all sets $X$, $\id_X$ is the identity function on $X$, and_
* _for all morphisms $f:X\to Y$ and $g:Y\to Z$, $g\circ f$ is the composite function of $g$ after $f$._
