``` ad-Proposition
title: Proposition.

_Let $K$ be a field. The category of vector spaces $\cat{Vect}_K$ over $K$ is a locally-small category._

```

_Proof_. The axioms of a locally-small category are all inherited from that of $\cat{Set}$, and the fact that the identity and composite morphisms in $\cat{Vect}_K$ are linear maps are proved; see links above.<span style="float:right;">$\blacksquare$</span>
