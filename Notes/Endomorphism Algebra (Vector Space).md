title: Definition.

_Let $V$ be a $K$-vector space. The **endomorphism algebra over $V$** is the unital associative algebra $\edm\l(V\r)\coloneqq\hom\l(V,V\r)$ equipped with the composition operation $\circ$._

```

**Remark.** From the links above, we see that $\edm\l(V\r)$ is a $K$-vector space and that the composition
$$\begin{equation}
    \circ:\edm\l(V\r)\times\edm\l(V\r)\to\edm\l(V\r)
\end{equation}$$
is a unital and associative binary operation that distributes over $+$ and is compatible with $\cdot$.<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>
