title: Proposition.

_Let $K$ be a field and consider a vector space $V$ over $K$. If $\mc{B}_1\coloneqq\l\{u_1,\dots,u_m\r\}$ and $\mc{B}_2\coloneqq\l\{w_1,\dots,w_n\r\}$ are both bases of $V$, then $n=m$._

```

_Proof_. Since $\mc{B}_1$ and $\mc{B}_2$ are both bases of $V$, we have, in particular, that $\mc{B}_2$ is linearly independent and that $\span \mc{B}_1=V$. It follows then that $n\leq m$. Similarly, we have that $m\leq n$, so $m=n$ as desired.<span style="float:right;">$\blacksquare$</span>
