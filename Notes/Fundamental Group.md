title: Definition.

_Let $X$ be a topological space and fix $x_0\in X$. The **fundamental group of $X$ based at $x_0$** is the group $\pi_1\l(X,x_0\r)$ of homotopy classes of loops at $x_0$ under concatenation._
* _If $X$ is path-connected, then the **fundamental group of $X$** is $\pi_1\l(X\r)\coloneqq\pi_1\l(X,x_0\r)$, independent of the base point._

```

**Remark.** That the operation $\l[\gamma\r]\l[\delta\r]\coloneqq\l[\gamma\ast\delta\r]$ is well-defined follows from the fact that the homotopy class of $\gamma\ast\delta$ depends only on the homotopy classes of $\gamma$ and $\beta$, which is proven in the link above. That $\pi_1\l(X,x_0\r)$ is a group is also proved, with $\l[\gamma\r]^{-1}=\l[\gamma^-\r]$.<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>
