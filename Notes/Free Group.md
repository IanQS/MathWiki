title: Definition.

_Let $X$ be a set. A **free group on $X$** is a group $F\l(X\r)$ equipped with a function $j:X\to F\l(X\r)$ such that for any group $G$ and function $f:X\to G$, there exists a unique group homomorphism $\phi:F\l(X\r)\to G$ such that $f=\phi\circ j$. That is, the diagram below commutes:_

_A group $G$ is said to be **free** if there is some set $A$ such that $G=F\l(A\r)$, in which case $A$ is a **free basis for $G$** and $\l|A\r|$ is called the **rank of $G$**._
