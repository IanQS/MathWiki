title: Definition.

A commutative ring $R$ is said to be <b>Noetherian</b> if it satisfies any of the following equivalent conditions:
* Every ascending chain $I_1\subseteq I_2\subseteq\cdots$ of ideals in $R$ stabilizes; that is, there exists some $n\geq1$ such that $I_m=I_n$ for all $m\geq n$.
* Every non-empty set $\mc{F}$ of ideals in $R$ has a $\subseteq$-maximal element.
* Every ideal $I$ in $R$ is finitely-generated.
