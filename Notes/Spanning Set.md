title: Definition.

_Let $K$ be a field and consider a vector space $V$ over $K$. Then any subset $S\subseteq V$ is said to be a **spanning set of $V$** if $\span\l(S\r)=V$._

```

**Remark.** In other words, a subset $S\subseteq V$ is a spanning set of $V$ if every $v\in V$ can be written as a (finite) linear combination of vectors in $V$.<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>
