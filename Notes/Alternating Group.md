``` ad-Definition
title: Definition.

_Let $X\coloneqq\l\{1,\dots,n\r\}$. The **alternating group of degree $n$** is the permutation group $A_n\coloneqq\ker\epsilon$ where $\epsilon:S_n\to\l\{\pm1\r\}$ is the sign homomorphism._

```

**Remark.** Take $\sigma\in A_n$. Since $S_n$ is generated by transpositions, $\sigma$ is generated by, say, $m$ transpositions. But $\epsilon\l(\tau\r)=-1$ for all transpositions $\tau\in S_n$, so $m$ is even. Hence every permutation in $A_n$ is generated by an even number of transpositions.<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>
