``` ad-Proposition
title: Proposition.

Let $\mf{a}\ideal R$ be a proper ideal of a commutative ring $R$. If $\mf{a}$ is maximal, then it is prime.

```

<i>Proof.</i> If $\mf{a}$ is maximal, then $R/\mf{a}$ is a field and is hence an integral domain. Thus $\mf{a}$ is prime, as desired.<span style="float:right;">$\blacksquare$</span>
