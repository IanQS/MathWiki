title: Definition.

_A group $G$ is said to be **cyclic** if $G=\gen{x}$ for some $x\in G$, in which case $x$ is said to be a **generator of $G$**._

```

**Remark.** It is clear that every cyclic group is Abelian, for if $g,h\in G$, then $g=x^m$ and $h=x^n$ for some $n,m\in\Z$. Then $gh=x^mx^n=x^nx^m=hg$.<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>
