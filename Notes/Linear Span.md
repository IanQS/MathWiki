title: Definition.

_Let $K$ be a field and consider a subset $S\subseteq V$ of a vector space $V$ over $K$. The **linear span of $S$** is the linear subspace consisting of the set_
$$\begin{equation}
    \span\l(S\r)\coloneqq\bigcap\l\{W\subseteq V\mid W\textit{ is a linear subspace of }V\r\}
\end{equation}$$
_together with the restricted operations on $\span\l(S\r)$._
