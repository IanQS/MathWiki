title: Definition.

_Let $K$ be a field and consider a subset $S\subseteq V$ of a vector space $V$ over $K$. The **linear subspace spaned by $S$** is the linear subspace consisting of the set_
$$\begin{equation}
    \span\l(S\r)\coloneqq\bigcap\l\{W\subseteq V\mid W\textit{ is a linear subspace of }V\r\}
\end{equation}$$
_together with the restricted operations on $\span\l(S\r)$._

```

**Remark.** If $S=\l\{s_1,\dots,s_n\r\}$, then, abusing notation, we shall call $\span\l(S\r)$ the **linear subspace spanned by $s_1,\dots,s_n$**.<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>
