title: Definition.

_Let $X$ and $Y$ be sets and consider a function $f:X\to Y$._
* _If $X$ (resp. $Y$) is a totally ordered set, then $f$ is said to be a **function from** (resp. **into**) **an ordered space**._

_If $X$ and $Y$ are both totally ordered sets, then $f$ is said to be a **function between ordered spaces**._
