title: Definition.

Let $R$ be a ring and fix $a\in R$. The <b>left</b> (resp <b>right</b>) <b>principal ideal generated by $a$</b> is the ideal $Ra\coloneqq\l\{ra\in R\mid r\in R\r\}$ (resp. $aR\coloneqq\l\{ar\in R\mid r\in R\r\}$).
* The <b>two-sided principal ideal generated by $a$</b> is the ideal $RaR$ consisting of all elements of the form $\sum r_ias_i$ for $r_i,s_i\in R$.

If $R$ is commutative, then the three notions coincide and we call $\gen{a}$ the <b>principal ideal generated by $a$</b>.

```

<b>Remark.</b> More generally, for $a_1,\dots,a_n\in R$, the <b>(left) ideal generated by $a_1,\dots,a_n$</b> is the ideal $\gen{a_1,\dots,a_n}$ consisting of all elements of the form $\sum r_ia_i$ for $r_i\in R$. This is clearly the intersection of all left ideals containing $a_1,\dots,a_n$.<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>
