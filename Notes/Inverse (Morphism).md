title: Definition.

_Let $\cat{C}$ be a category and fix a morphism $f:X\to Y$. A morphism $g:Y\to X$ is said to be the **inverse of $f$** if the diagram_

_commutes; that is, if $g$ is both a left and a right inverse of $f$._

```

**Remark.** If $f:X\to Y$ has an inverse, we say that $f$ is **invertible**. The inverse is also necessarily unique and can thus be denoted by $f^{-1}$.<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>
