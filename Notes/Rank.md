title: Definition.

_Let $V$ and $W$ be vector spaces over some field $K$ and consider a linear map $T:V\to W$. The **rank of $T$** is_
$$\begin{equation}
    \rank T\coloneqq\dim\im T.
\end{equation}$$
_If $V$ and $W$ are finite-dimensional, say with $n\coloneqq\dim V$ and $m\coloneqq\dim W$, we define the **rank of a matrix** $A\in\mat{m\times n}{K}$ as the rank of its associated left-multiplication map $L_A$._
