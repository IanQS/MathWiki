title: Proposition.

_Let $X$ and $Y$ be path-connected topological spaces. Then $\pi_1\l(X\times Y\r)\iso\pi_1\l(X\r)\times\pi_1\l(Y\r)$._

```

_Proof_. Every loop $\gamma:I\to X\times Y$ can be uniquely decomposed into its components $\gamma_1:I\to X$ and $\gamma_2:I\to Y$, and similarly every homotopy $H:I\times I\to X\times Y$ can be uniquely decomposed into the homotopies $H_1:I\times I\to X$ and $H_2:I\times I\to Y$. Thus $\l[\gamma\r]\mapsto\tpl{\l[\gamma_1\r],\l[\gamma_2\r]}$ is a well-defined isomorphism, as desired.<span style="float:right;">$\blacksquare$</span>
