title: Definition.

_Let $<$ be the standard ordering on the real numbers $\R$. The **standard topology on $\R$** is the order topology_ $\mc{T}(<)$_._

```

**Remark.** Since $\R$ is unbounded (in both directions), we see that $\mc{T}\l(<\r)\coloneqq\mc{T}\l(\mc{B}\r)$ where
$$\begin{equation}
    \mc{B}\coloneqq\l\{B\in\pow\l(\R\r)\mid\ex a,b\in\R:a<b\land B=\l(a,b\r)\r\}.\exqedin
\end{equation}$$
