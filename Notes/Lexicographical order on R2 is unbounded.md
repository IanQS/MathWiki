title: Proposition.

_Let $\tpl{\R,<}$ be the set of real numbers equipped with its standard order. Then the ordered set $\tpl{\R^2,<_L}$ where $<_L$ is the lexicographical order on $\R^2$ is unbounded._

```

_Proof_. Take $\tpl{a,b}\in\R^2$ and observe that $\tpl{a,b-1}<_L\tpl{a,b}$, so $\R^2$ with the lexicographical order does not have a least element.<span style="float:right;">$\blacksquare$</span>
