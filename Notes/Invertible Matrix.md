title: Definition.

_Let $K$ be a field and fix $n\in\N$. A matrix $A\in\mat{n}{K}$ is said to be **invertible** if there exists $B\in\mat{n}{K}$ such that $B$ is both a left and a right inverse of $A$; that is, if_
$$\begin{equation}
    AB=BA=I_n,
\end{equation}$$
_in which case we write $B\coloneqq A^{-1}$ and call it the **inverse of $A$**._
