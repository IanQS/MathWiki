title: Definition.

_Let $G$ be a group acting on a set $X$ via $\phi:G\to\Aut\l(X\r)$. The action $\phi$ is said to be **transitive** if for all $x,y\in X$, there is some $g\in G$ such that $y=gx$._

```

**Remark.** In other words, $\phi$ is transitive iff there is only one orbit; that is, $X$ is $\textrm{`}$connected$\textrm{'}$ via actions.<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>
