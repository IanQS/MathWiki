title: Theorem (Linear Invertibility Theorem).

_Let $V$ be a finite-dimensional vector space, say with $n\coloneqq\dim V$, and let $T\in\End\l(V\r)$. The following are equivalent:_
1. _$T$ is invertible._
2. _$\im T=V$ (equivalently, $\rank T=n$)._
3. _$\ker T=\l\{0\r\}$ (equivalently, $\nullity T=0$)._
4. _$\det T\neq0$._
5. _$T^\dual$ is invertible._

```

_Proof_. Clearly $1\Rightarrow2$ and $1\Rightarrow3$. Conversely, $2\Leftrightarrow3$ by the Dimension Theorem and they each imply $1$. It remains to show that $1\Leftrightarrow4$ and $1\Leftrightarrow5$.
* ($1\Leftrightarrow4$): 
* ($1\Leftrightarrow5$):
