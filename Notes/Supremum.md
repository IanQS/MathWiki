title: Definition.

_Let $\l\langle X,\leq\r\rangle$ be a poset and fix $S\subseteq X$. The **supremum of $S$ in $X$** is an upper bound $u$ of $S$ in $X$ such that $u\leq u'$ for all upper bounds $u'$ of $S$ in $X$._

```

**Remark.** If $u$ is the supremum of $S$, write $\sup S\coloneqq u$. In the context of lattice theory, the supremum is also called the **join of $S$** and is denoted by $\bigvee S$.<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>
