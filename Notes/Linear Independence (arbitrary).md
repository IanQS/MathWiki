title: Definition.

_Let $K$ be a field and consider a vector space $V$ over $K$. A subset $U\subseteq V$ is said to be **linearly independent** if the only vanishing linear combination of vectors in $U$ is the trivial one. Formally, if_
$$\begin{equation}
    \fa n\in\N^\ast,\fa\l\langle u_1,\dots,u_n\r\rangle\in U^n:\l\langle u_i\r\rangle\textrm{ \it{is linearly independent}}.
\end{equation}$$

```

**Remark.** Note that the statement (vacuously) holds for $n=0$, so to prove that $U$ is linearly independent, it suffices to check it for $n\geq1$.<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>
