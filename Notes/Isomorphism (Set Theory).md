title: Definition.

_Two sets $X$ and $Y$ are said to be **(set-)isomorphic** if there exists a bijection $f:X\to Y$._

```

**Remark.** If $X$ and $Y$ are isomorphic, write $X\iso Y$. One can interpret the symbol $\textrm{`}\iso\textrm{'}$ as a binary relation, in which case it is also an equivalence relation, but, formally, this is just notation.<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>
