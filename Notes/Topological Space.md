title: Definition.

_Let $X$ be a set. A **topology on $X$** is a family $\mc{T}\subseteq\pow\l(X\r)$ such that_
* _$\em,X\in\mc{T}$._
* _Arbitrary unions of elements in $\mc{T}$ are in $\mc{T}$._
* _Finite intersections of elements in $\mc{T}$ are in $\mc{T}$._

_The set $X$, equipped with a topology $\mc{T}$ on $X$, is called a **topological space**._
