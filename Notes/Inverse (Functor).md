title: Definition.

_Let $\cat{C}$ and $\cat{D}$ be categories and fix a functor $\ms{F}:\cat{C}\to\cat{D}$. A functor $\ms{G}:\cat{D}\to\cat{C}$ is said to be the **inverse of $\ms{F}$** if $\ms{F}$ admits both left and right inverses._

```

**Remark.** If $\ms{F}:\cat{C}\to\cat{D}$ has a strict inverse, we say that $\ms{F}$ is **strictly invertible**; the inverse is also necessarily unique and can thus be denoted by $\ms{F}^{-1}$.<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>
