title: Definition.

_Let $f:X\to Y$. A function $g:Y\to X$ is said to be the **inverse of $f$** if $g$ is both a left and a right inverse of $f$._

```

**Remark.** In other words, if $g\circ f=\id_X$ and $f\circ g=\id_Y$. This relationship can also be expressed by stating that the diagram

---

**Remark.** If $f:X\to Y$ has an inverse, we say that **$f$ is invertible**. The inverse is also necessarily unique and can thus be denoted by $f^{-1}$.<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>
