title: Definition.

_Let $f:X\to Y$. A function $f^{-1}:Y\to X$ is an **inverse of $f$** if $f^{-1}$ is both a left and right inverse of $f$._

```

**Remark.** In other words, if $f^{-1}\circ f=\id_X$ and $f\circ f^{-1}=\id_Y$. This relationship can also be expressed by stating that the diagram

commutes.<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>

---

**Remark.** If $f:X\to Y$ has an inverse, we say that **$f$ is invertible**.<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>
