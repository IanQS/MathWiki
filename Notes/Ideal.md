title: Definition.

_Let $R$ be a ring. A subring $I\subseteq R$ is an **ideal in $R$** if it is stable under multiplication; that is, if_
$$\begin{equation}
    \fa r\in R:rI,Ir\subseteq I.
\end{equation}$$

```

**Remark.** If one takes rings as having unity, then ideals are defined to be sub_group_ of $R$ that is stable under multiplication. Otherwise, the only ideal of $R$ is the trivial ideal $\ideal{0}$ and $R$ itself.<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>

---

**Remark.** Since the additive group of $R$ is Abelian, we see that every ideal in $R$ is a normal subgroup thereof.<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>
