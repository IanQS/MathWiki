title: Definition.

Let $R$ be a ring. A subset $\mf{a}\subseteq R$ is a <b>left ideal ix $R$</b> if it is an additive subgroup of $R$ such that $R\mf{a}\subseteq\mf{a}$.
* Similarly for a <b>right ideal in $R$</b>. A two-sided ideal in $R$ is called an <b>ideal in $R$</b>. If $R$ is commutative, then every ideal is two-sided.

```

<b>Remark.</b> A left ideal $\mf{a}\subseteq R$ is a left $R$-module via the action $R\times\mf{a}\to\mf{a}:\tpl{r,i}\mapsto ri$; being a left-ideal ensures that $ri\in\mf{a}$. Indeed $\mf{a}$ is a left $R$-submodule of $R$, where $R$ is viewed as a left $R$-module over itself.<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>

<b>Remark.</b> Since the additive group of $R$ is abelian, we see that every ideal in $R$ is a normal subgroup thereof.<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>
