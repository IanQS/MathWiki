``` ad-Proposition
title: Proposition.

_Let $K$ be a field and consider a vector space $V$ over $K$. If $V$ is spanned by a finite set of vectors $w_1,\dots,w_m$, then any linearly independent subset $U\subseteq V$ is finite and contains no more than $m$ vectors._

_In other words, letting $W\coloneqq\l\{w_1,\dots,w_m\r\}$, we have that $\l|U\r|\leq\l|W\r|$._
