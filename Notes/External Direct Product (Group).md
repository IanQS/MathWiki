``` ad-Definition
title: Definition.

Let $\l\{G_i\r\}$ be a family of groups. The **(external) direct product of $\l\{G_i\r\}$** is the Cartesian product $\prod G_i$ equipped with the component-wise defined binary operation.

```

**Remark.** The direct product $\prod G_i$, equipped with the projection maps $\l\{\pi_i\r\}$, is a product in $\catgrp$.<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>

**Remark.** In particular, if $X$ is a non-empty set, then $\prod_{x\in X}G=G^X$ is the function group from $X$ into $G$.<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>
