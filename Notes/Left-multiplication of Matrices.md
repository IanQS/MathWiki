title: Definition.

_Let $K$ be a field and fix $m,n\in\N^\ast$. To every matrix $A\in\mat{m\times n}{K}$, the **left-multiplication map induced by $A$** is the linear map_
$$\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
        L_A:K^n&\to K^m \\
        \v{x}&\mapsto A\v{x}.
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}$$
