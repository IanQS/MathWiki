title: Definition.

_Let $X$ be a topological space. A **covering map of $X$** is a continuous map $p:E\to X$ from a topological space $E$ such that for all $p\in X$, there exists a neighborhood $U$ of $p$ in $X$ where_ $p^{-1}\!\l(U\r)=\coprod_{i\in I}V_i$ _for some disjoint open sets $V_i$ of $E$ and where each_ $\l.p\r|_{V_i}:V_i\to X$ _is a homeomorphism._
* _If $p:E\to X$ is a covering map, then $E$ is said to be a **covering space of $X$**, the neighborhood $U$ is said to be **evenly-covered** by the **sheets** $V_i\subseteq E$._
