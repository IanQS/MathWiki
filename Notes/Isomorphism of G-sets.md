title: Definition.

Let $G$ be a group acting on sets $X$ and $Y$. We say that $X$ and $Y$ are **isomorphic as $G$-sets** if there exists an invertible $G$-equivariant map $f:X\to Y$, called a **$G$-isomorphism**.

```

<b>Remark.</b> That is, $G$-isomorphisms are isomorphisms in $\catgset$. Since $\textrm{`}$is isomorphic to$\textrm{'}$ is an equivalence relation, we shall write $X\iso Y$.<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>
