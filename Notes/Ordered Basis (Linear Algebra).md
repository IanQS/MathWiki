title: Definition.

_Let $K$ be a field and consider a vector sapce $V$ over $K$. An **ordered basis of $V$** is a pair $\l\langle\mc{B},<\r\rangle$ where $\mc{B}$ is a basis for $V$ and $<$ is a total order on $\mc{B}$._

```

**Remark.** If $\mc{B}=\l\{b_1,\dots,b_n\r\}$ for some $n\in\N$, then we shall, by abuse of notation, refer to $\mc{B}$ itself as an ordered basis since it it clear that the ordering is induced by the indices. This is especially the case when we wish to consider the dimension of $V$, defined as $\dim V\coloneqq\l|\mc{B}\r|$ and _not_ $\l|\l\langle\mc{B},<\r\rangle\r|$; that is, we shall only consider the underlying set of the ordered basis as far as dimensions are concerned.<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>
