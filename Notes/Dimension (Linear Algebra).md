``` ad-Definition
title: Definition.

_Let $K$ be a field and consider a vector space $V$ over $K$. The **dimension of $V$** is $\dim V\coloneqq\l|\mc{B}\r|$ where $\mc{B}\subseteq V$ is any basis for $V$._

```

**Remark.** This definition is justified by the following:
1. Every vector space has a basis, so we may talk about _a_ cardinality.
2. All bases of a vector space have the same cardinality, so we may talk about _the_ cardinality.

These facts are non-trivial for the infinite-dimensional case.<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>
