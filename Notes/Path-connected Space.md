title: Definition.

_A topological space $X$ is said to be **path-connected** if for all $p,q\in X$, there exists a path $\gamma:\l[0,1\r]\to X$ with $\gamma\l(0\r)=p$ and $\gamma\l(1\r)=q$._
* _We say that $X$ is **locally path-connected** if for all $p\in X$ and all neighborhoods $U$ of $p$, there exists a path-connected neighborhood $V\subseteq U$ of $p$._
