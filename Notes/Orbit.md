title: Definition.

_Let $G$ be a group acting on a set $X$. The **orbit of $x$ under $G$** is the set $Gx\coloneqq\l\{gx\in X\mid g\in G\r\}$._

```

**Remark.** Orbits induce a canonical equivalence relation on $X$ by defining $x\sim y$ iff $y=gx$ for some $g\in G$, which makes them the equivalence classes under this relation. Thus the orbits $Gx$ are elements in the quotient set $G/\!\sim$, so we have a partition $X=\coprod_{i\in I}Gx_i$. Within any one $Gx_i$, the restricted action is transitive.<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>
