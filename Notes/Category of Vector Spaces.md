_Let $K$ be a field. The **category of vector spaces over $K$** is the (locally-small) category $\catvect$ whose objects are vector spaces and whose morphisms are linear maps._

```

**Remark.** That $\catvect$ is a category follows from the fact that identities and compositions of linear maps are linear.<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>
