title: Definition.

_Let_ $\l\{V_i\r\}$ _be a family of $K$-vector spaces. The_ **_(external) direct product of_ $\l\{V_i\r\}$** _is the direct product $\prod V_i$ of groups equipped with the component-wise defined left $K$-action._

```

**Remark.** The direct product $\prod V_i$, equipped with the projection maps $\l\{\pi_i\r\}$, is a product in $\catvect$.<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>

---

**Remark.** In particular, if $X$ is a non-empty set, then $\prod_{x\in X}K=K^X$, where $K$ is viewed as a vector space over itself, is the function space of $X$ into $K$.<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>
