``` ad-Proposition
title: Proposition.

Let $\R$ be the set of real numbers. Then the upper-limit topology $\ULtopR$, lower-limit topology $\LLtopR$, and the $K$ topology $\KtopR$ on $\R$ are all strictly finer than the standard topology $\sttopR$ on $\R$.

Furthermore, $\ULtopR$ is strictly finer than $\KtopR$, and $\LLtopR$ is not comparable with either $\ULtopR$ or $\KtopR$.

```

_Proof_. See links above.<span style="float:right;">$\blacksquare$</span>

**Remark.** The relationship between these topologies can be illustrated with the following Hasse diagram:

A line segment that points upward indicate a subset relation. If any two topologies are not connected with line segments that only point upward, then they are not comparable.<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>
