title: Definition.

_Let $V$ be a finite-dimensional vector space over some field $K$ and consider a linear operator $T:V\to V$. A nonzero vector $v\in V$ is called an **eigenvector of $T$** if there exists some $\lambda\in K$ such that $T\l(v\r)=\lambda v$, in which case $\lambda$ is called the **eigenvalue of $T$ corresponding to $v$**._

```

**Remark.** Let $A\in\mat{n}{K}$. A nonzero vector $\v{v}\in K^n$ is called an **eigenvector of $A$** if there exists some $\lambda\in K$ such that $A\v{v}=\lambda\v{v}$, in which case $\lambda$ is called the **eigenvalue of $A$ corresponding to $\v{v}$**.<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>
