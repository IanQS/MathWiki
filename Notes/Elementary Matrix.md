title: Definition.

_Let $K$ be a field and fix $m\in\N^\ast$. A matrix $E\in\mat{m}{K}$ is said to be an **elementary matrix** if there exists a single elementary row operation $e\in\mat{m}{K}\to \mat{m}{K}$ such that $E=e\l(I_m\r)$_

```

**Remark.** If $e$ is of type $1$ (resp. $2$; $3$), we say that its corresponding elementary matrix $E=e\l(I\r)$ is of type $1$ (resp. $2$; $3$).<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>
