title: Definition.

_Let $G$ and $H$ be groups. We say that $G$ and $H$ are **isomorphic as groups** if there exists an invertible group homomorphism $\phi:G\to H$, called a **group isomorphism**._

```

**Remark.** That is, group isomorphisms are isomorphisms in $\catgrp$. Since $\textrm{`}$is isomorphic to$\textrm{'}$ is an equivalence relation, we shall write $G\iso H$.<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>
