title: Definition.

_Let $X$ and $Y$ be topological spaces. A continuous map $f:X\to Y$ is a **homotopy equivalence** if there exists a continuous map $g:Y\to X$ such that $g\circ f\htopeq\id_X$ and $f\circ g\htopeq\id_Y$._
* _If such a function exists, then $X$ and $Y$ are said to be **homotopic equivalence**, or have the same **homotopy type**, and we write $X\htopeq Y$._
* _If $X$ is homotopic to a point, we say that $X$ is **contractible**._
