title: Definition.

Let $V$ be a vector space. A **projection on $V$** is a linear operator $P:V\to V$ such that $P^2=P$.

```

**Remark.** Every projection is diagonalizable, for consider the polynomial $f\coloneqq x^2-x\in K\l[x\r]$ and observe that $f\l(P\r)=P^2-P=0$. Then the minimal polynomial of $P$ divides $x\l(x-1\r)$, so it splits into distinct linear factors.<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>
