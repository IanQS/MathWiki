title: Theorem (Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem).

_Every bounded sequence $\tpl{x_n}$ in $\R$ contains a convergent subsequence._

```

_Proof_. By the Monotone Subsequence Theorem, the sequence $\tpl{x_n}$ has a monotone subsequence $\tpl{x_{n_k}}$. But $\tpl{x_n}$ is bounded, so $\tpl{x_{n_k}}$ is bounded too and hence converges by the Monotone Convergence Theorem.<span style="float:right;">$\blacksquare$</span>
