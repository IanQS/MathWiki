``` ad-Definition
title: Definition.

_Let $u$ be a non-empty set. The **intersection of $u$** is the set_
$$\begin{equation}
    \bigcap u\coloneqq\l\{x\mid\fa v\l(v\in u\Rightarrow x\in v\r)\r\}.
\end{equation}$$

```

**Remark.** For the pair set $\l\{u,v\r\}$, write $u\cap v\coloneqq\bigcap\l\{u,v\r\}$.<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>

---

**Remark.** One can also write the intersection $\bigcap u$ using $\textrm{`}$index$\textrm{'}$ notation as $\bigcap_{v\in u}v$.<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>
