``` ad-Proposition
title: Proposition.

_Let $\leq$ and $\preceq$ be total orders on the sets $X$ and $Y$, respectively. Then their lexicographical order $\sqsubseteq$ is a total order on $X\times Y$._

```

_Proof_. Since $\sqsubseteq\,=\rfcl\sqsubset$ and $\sqsubset$ is a strict total order, we see that $\sqsubseteq$ is a total order on $X\times Y$.<span style="float:right;">$\blacksquare$</span>
