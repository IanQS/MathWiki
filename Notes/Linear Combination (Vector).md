title: Definition.

_Let $V$ be a vector space over a field $K$ and fix vectors $v_1,\dots,v_n\in V$. A vector $v\in V$ is said to be a **linear combination of $v_1,\dots,v_n$** if_
$$\begin{equation}
    \ex\alpha_1,\dots,\alpha_n\in K:v=\sum_{i=1}^n\alpha_iv_i.
\end{equation}$$

```

**Remark.** Call the linear combination of $v_1,\dots,v_n$ formed by taking each $\alpha_i=0$ the **trivial linear combination**.<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>
