title: Proposition.

_The category of sets $\cat{Set}$ is a category._

```

_Proof_. The fact that the composition function is associative and that identities are idempotent are proved; see links above. For $\axicat{3}$, simply observe that the domain and codomain of a function $f$ is specified in its definition, so if $f\in\hom\l(X,Y\r)$ for some sets $X$ and $Y$, it cannot be the case that $f\in\hom\l(Z,W\r)$ for sets $Z\neq X$ and $W\neq Y$.<span style="float:right;">$\blacksquare$</span>
