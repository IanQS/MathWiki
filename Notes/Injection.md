``` ad-Definition
title: Definition.

A function $f:X\to Y$ is an **injection** if
$$\begin{equation}
    \fa x,x'\in X:f\l(x\r)=f\l(x'\r)\Rightarrow x=x'.
\end{equation}$$
That is, if the relation $f$ is left-unique.

```

<b>Remark.</b> If $f:X\to Y$ is an injection (or an **injective function**, or a **1-1 function**), write $f:X\into Y$.
* Sometimes, it is convenient to write $X\into Y$ to indicate that there exists an injection $f:X\into Y$, in which case we read **$X$ injects into $Y$**.<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>
