title: Definition.

_A function $f:X\to Y$ is an **injection** if_
$$\begin{equation}
    \fa x,x'\in X:f\l(x\r)=f\l(x'\r)\Rightarrow x=x'.
\end{equation}$$

```

**Remark.**
* We do not need to specify that the injection $\textrm{`}$is w.r.t. $X\textrm{'}$ since the set $X$ is uniquely determined by $f$; recall that $X=\dom f$.
* If $f:X\to Y$ is an injection (or an **injective function**, or a **1-1 function**), write $f:X\into Y$.<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>
