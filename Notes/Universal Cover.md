title: Definition.

_Let $X$ be a connected locally path-connected space. A **universal cover of $X$** is a connected cover $p:\widetilde{X}\to X$ such that for every connected cover $q:E\to X$, there exists a unique continuous map $\sigma:\widetilde{X}\to E$ making the diagram below commute._

```

**Remark.** If $\widetilde{X}$ is simply-connected and locally path-connected, then the Lifting Criterion shows that $p:\widetilde{X}\to X$ is a universal cover of $X$. Conversely, it can be shown that any universal covering of a connected, locally path-connected, and semilocally simply-connected space is simply-connected.<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>
