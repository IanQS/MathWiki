title: Definition.

_Let $G$ be a group and fix a subset $S\subseteq G$. The **subgroup generated by $S$** is the smallest subgroup of $G$ containing $S$:_
$$\begin{equation}
    \gen{S}\coloneqq\bigcap\l\{H\subseteq G\mid S\subseteq H\land H\textrm{\it{ is a subgroup of G}}\r\}.
\end{equation}$$
_If $\gen{S}=G$, then $S$ is said to **generate $G$**._

```

**Remark.** Equivalently, $\gen{S}\coloneqq\l\{g\in G\mid\ex s_i\in S\land\ex\epsilon_i=\pm1:g=s_1^{\epsilon_1}\cdots s_n^{\epsilon_n}\r\}$ contains all elements $g\in G$ that can be expressed as a (finite) product of elements in $S$ and their inverses. If $S=\l\{s_1,\dots,s_n\r\}$, we write $\gen{s_1,\dots,s_n}\coloneqq\gen{S}$.<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>
