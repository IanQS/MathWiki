title: Definition.

Let $G$ be a group. The **category of $G$-sets** is the (locally-small) category $\catgset$ whose objects are $G$-sets and whose morphisms are $G$-equivariant maps.

```

**Remark.** That $\catgset$ is a category follows from the fact that identities and compositions of $G$-equivariant maps are $G$-equivariant.<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>
