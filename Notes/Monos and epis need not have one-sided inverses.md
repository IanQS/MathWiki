title: Proposition.

_There exists a category $\cat{C}$ whose monomorphisms (resp. epimorphisms) need not have left (resp. right) inverses._

```

_Proof_. Consider the preorder category $\cat{C}$ induced by the preordered set $\l\langle\Z,\leq\r\rangle$ where $\leq$ is the standard ordering on $\Z$. We claim that every morphism in $\cat{C}$ is a monomorphism and an epimorphism, and that there exist morphisms with no inverses.
