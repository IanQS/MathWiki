title: Definition.

_Let $K$ denote either $\R$ or $\C$ and let $V$ be an inner product space over $K$. Two vector $v,w\in V$ are said to be **orthogonal** if $\bilform{v}{w}=0$, in which case we write $v\perp w$._

```

**Remark.** Note that this definition makes sense since $\bilform{v}{w}=\bar{\bilform{w}{v}}=0$ iff $\bilform{w}{v}=0$. Other easy consequences are
$$\begin{equation}
    \bilform{0}{v}=0\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \textrm{and}\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \bilform{v}{v}=0\Rightarrow v=0
\end{equation}$$
for all $v\in V$; that is, $0$ is orthogonal to every vector and is the only vector orthogonal to itself.<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>
