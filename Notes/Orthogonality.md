title: Definition.

_Let $K$ denote either $\R$ or $\C$ and let $V$ be an inner product space over $K$._
* _Two vectors $u,w\in V$ are said to be **orthogonal** if $\bilform{u}{w}=0$, in which case we write $u\perp w$._

* _A vector $u\in V$ is said to be **orthogonal** to a subspace $W\subseteq V$ if $u\perp w$ for all $w\in W$, in which case we write $u\perp W$._
* _Two subspaces $U,W\subseteq V$ are said to be **orthogonal** if $u\perp w$ for all $u\in U$ and $w\in W$, in which case we write $U\perp W$._
