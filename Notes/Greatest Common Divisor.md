title: Definition.

_Let $a,b\in\Z$. An element $d\in\Z\comp\l\{0\r\}$ is said to be a **greatest common divisor of $a$ and $b$** if_
* _$d$ is a common divisor of $a$ and $b$, and_
* _for all common divisors $d'$ of $a$ and $b$, $d\divides d'$._

_The greatest common divisor of $a$ and $b$ is, up to sign, unique; we write $\gcd\l(a,b\r)\coloneqq\l|d\r|$._
