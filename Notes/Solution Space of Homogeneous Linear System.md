title: Definition.

_Let $K$ be a field and consider an $m\times n$ homogeneous linear system $A\v{x}=\v{0}$ for some fixed $m,n\in\N$. The **solution space of $A\v{x}=\v{0}$** is the linear subspace of $\mat{n\times1}{K}$ consisting of the set_
$$\begin{equation}
    \l\{\v{x}\in\mat{n\times1}{K}\mid A\v{x}=\v{0}\r\}
\end{equation}$$
_together with its induced operations from $\mat{n\times1}{K}$._
