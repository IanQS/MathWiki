title: Definition.

_Let $\tpl{X,<}$ be a totally ordered set and let $\mc{T}$ be its induced order topology. Fix $x\in X$. A sequence_ $\tpl{x_n}_{n\in\N}$ _in $X$ is said to **converge to $x$ w.r.t. $<$**, and $x$ is said to be a **limit of $\tpl{x_n}$ w.r.t. $<$**, if_
$$\begin{equation}
    \fa U\in\mc{U}_x,\fa^\infty n\in\N:x_n\in U,
\end{equation}$$
_where $\mc{U}_x$ is the set of all neighborhoods of $x$, in which case we write_ $\lim\limits_{n\to\infty}x_n=x$ _or $x_n\to x$ as $n\to\infty$._
