title: Proposition.

_Let $\l\langle\N,<\r\rangle$ be the set of natural numbers equipped with its standard order. Then the ordered set $\l\langle\N^2,<_L\r\rangle$ where $<_L$ is the lexicographical order on $\N^2$ is bounded below (but not upwards)._

```

_Proof_. Take $\l\langle m,n\r\rangle\in\N^2$ and observe that $\l\langle0,0\r\rangle\leq_L\l\langle m,n\r\rangle$ since $0$ is the least element in $\N$. On the other hand, observe that $\l\langle m,n\r\rangle<_L\l\langle m,n+1\r\rangle$, so $\N^2$ with the lexicographical order does not have a greatest element.<span style="float:right;">$\blacksquare$</span>
