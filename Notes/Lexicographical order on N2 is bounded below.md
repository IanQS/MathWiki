title: Proposition.

_Let $\tpl{\N,<}$ be the set of natural numbers equipped with its standard order. Then the ordered set $\tpl{\N^2,<_L}$ where $<_L$ is the lexicographical order on $\N^2$ is bounded below (but not upwards)._

```

_Proof_. Take $\tpl{m,n}\in\N^2$ and observe that $\tpl{0,0}\leq_L\tpl{m,n}$ since $0$ is the least element in $\N$. On the other hand, observe that $\tpl{m,n}<_L\tpl{m,n+1}$, so $\N^2$ with the lexicographical order does not have a greatest element.<span style="float:right;">$\blacksquare$</span>
