``` ad-Proposition
title: Proposition.

_Let $X$ be an initial segment of $\ON$. Then $X$ is itself an ordinal. Formally,_
$$\begin{equation}
    \fa\beta\in X,\fa\alpha\in\ON:\alpha\in\beta\Rightarrow\alpha\in X\ \ \ \ \Rightarrow\ \ \ \ X\in\ON.
\end{equation}$$

```

_Proof_. Since $\in$ is well-orders $\ON$ and $X\subseteq\ON$, we see that $\in$ well-orders $X$ too. Our hypothesis that $X$ is an initial segment simply states that every $\beta\in X$ is a subset of $X$, so $X$ is a transitive set.<span style="float:right;">$\blacksquare$</span>
